Brightness Control System
Power Budget: Set to 750 total brightness units across all LEDs (defined at cloudyMountain.ino:18) How it works:
cloudyMountain.ino:143-179 - calculateTotalBrightness() sums up all GRBW values across all 177 pixels
cloudyMountain.ino:182-194 - applyBrightnessLimit() calculates if scaling is needed
cloudyMountain.ino:197-252 - setStrandColor() automatically enforces the limit
Key features:
When total brightness exceeds 750, all LEDs are scaled down proportionally
Color ratios are preserved (colors don't shift)
Works automatically - you don't need to think about it
Serial monitor shows the scaling percentage when limiting occurs
Won't interfere with animations or other effects you add later - it applies uniformly to all pixels
Example: If you set all pixels to white (255,255,255,255 = 1020 per pixel), the system would detect the total exceeds 750 and automatically scale everything down to stay within your power budget. You can adjust MAX_TOTAL_BRIGHTNESS at any time if you find 750 is too restrictive or too generous for your power supply.
